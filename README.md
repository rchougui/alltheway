## Alltheway nextjs project

Design was imported from figma to a nextjs 14 app.
App dependencies :

- Nextjs 14
- Tailwindcss
- Shadcn ui

Some design elements were not pixel perfect (texts mostly) and instead were ported to the closes responsive units for better device support
(eg. hero title size in design was 52.2 px was ported to 3rem = 48px)
